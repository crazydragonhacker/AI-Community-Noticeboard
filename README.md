# 🏘️ AI Community Noticeboard

## 🚀 Hackathon Project

AI Community Noticeboard is an **AI-powered civic information platform** that helps communities access important public announcements such as jobs, health camps, welfare schemes, and emergency alerts through **WhatsApp, SMS, and voice-based communication**.

---

## 📌 Problem

Public information like job opportunities, government schemes, and health programs often fails to reach the people who need it most because:

- Information is scattered across multiple websites
- Notices are written in complex or English-only language
- Many communities have low digital literacy
- Rural and low-income populations face connectivity challenges

As a result, citizens miss opportunities that could improve their livelihood and wellbeing.

---

## 💡 Solution

AI Community Noticeboard acts as a **single intelligent bridge** between public systems and citizens.

The system:
- Collects announcements from verified public sources
- Uses AI to simplify and translate information
- Sends alerts via low-bandwidth and accessible platforms
- Supports voice-first interaction for inclusivity
